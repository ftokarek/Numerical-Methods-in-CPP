## Numerical Methods in C++

# A structured collection of C++ implementations of fundamental numerical methods. Each project was developed as part of academic # coursework and focuses on algorithmic clarity, convergence, and computational precision.

# 📂 Structure

# Each folder (01_, 02_, …) corresponds to a separate numerical method and contains:
	•	main.cpp – implementation in C++
	•	data.txt – sometimes included if the program requires input from file
	•	README or in-code comments for quick reference

# 🧮 Included Topics
	•	Lagrange interpolation
	•	Newton interpolation
	•	Gaussian elimination
	•	LU decomposition
	•	Jacobi method
	•	Numerical integration (geometric & Gauss quadratures)
	•	Solving differential equations (Euler, RK2, RK4)
