## Numerical Methods in C++

A structured collection of C++ implementations of fundamental numerical methods. 
Each project was developed as part of academic coursework and focuses on algorithmic clarity, convergence and computational precision.

# Structure

Each folder (01_, 02_, …) corresponds to a separate numerical method and contains:
	•	main.cpp – implementation in C++
	•	data.txt – sometimes included if the program requires input from a file
	•	README & in-code comments for quick reference

# Included Topics
	•	Lagrange interpolation
	•	Newton interpolation
	•	Gaussian elimination
	•	LU decomposition
	•	Jacobi method
	•	Numerical integration (geometric & Gauss quadratures)
	•	Solving differential equations (Euler, RK2, RK4)
